# HTML File Naming Conventions

Proper file naming avoids **deployment issues**, especially on **Linux-based servers and Azure**.

---

## Recommended Rules

✔ Use **lowercase letters**

```text
index.html
about.html
```

✔ Use **hyphens (-)** instead of spaces

```text
user-profile.html
contact-us.html
```

✔ Keep names **short and meaningful**

✔ Always use `.html` extension

---

## Avoid These

❌ Spaces

```text
my page.html
```

❌ Uppercase letters

```text
HomePage.HTML
```

❌ Special characters

```text
home@page.html
```

❌ Underscores (not SEO-friendly)

```text
user_profile.html
```

---

## Special Case: `index.html`

* Default page loaded by web servers
* Used as homepage

```text
index.html
```

---

## Why This Matters

* Case-sensitive servers (Azure, Linux)
* Better SEO
* Clean URLs
* Fewer deployment bugs

---

## Quick Summary

* lowercase
* hyphen-separated
* no spaces
* no special characters
